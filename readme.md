# Practice Repository

This repo is intended to be the place where i write down learning notes and most of my coding practice as a beginner. 
This is the place where all the ugly clueless coding and notes will go


**To best examine and understand my coding skill levels, it would be wiser to go to my other repos. Other repos will be intended to be more ambitious and display my (by then) more advanced coding skills**
